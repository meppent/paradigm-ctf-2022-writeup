# Just-in-time

## Explanation of the challenge

This challenge implements a [just-in-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) compiler written in Solidity. The contract `JIT` has a function `invoke` that takes two argument, `_program` and `stdin`, of type `bytes`. The first one is the input program written with custom opcodes that we will describe later, that will be translated to EVM opcodes during the compilation. After the compilation, the function deploys a contract with the bytecode obtained by the compilation and makes a `delegatecall` to the deployed contract with `_stdin` as input data.

The objective of the challenge is to steal 50eth given to the contract `JIT` at the beginning.

## Compiler description

### Input opcodes

The custom opcodes of the input program are given as bytes, that are the UTF-8 hexadecimal encoding of the opcodes. They are the following:
> `>` Adds 32 to the last item on the stack.  
> `<` Removes 32 to the last item on the stack.  
> `+` Adds 1 to the item at the memory address that is the last item on the stack.  
> `-` Removes 1 to the item at the memory address that is the last item on the stack.  
> `.` Logs the last byte of the item at the memory address that is the last item on the stack.  
> `,` Stores the n<sup>th</sup> byte of the calldata at the memory address that is the last item on the stack and increments n, where n is the second item on the stack.  
> `[` Begins a loop.  
> `]` Ends a loop.  
> `#` Does nothing.  

The loops are running while the item at the memory address that is the last item on the stack is not null. If this condition is not met at a `[` character, it will directly jump to the matching `]` character. For example, the program `[-]` will decrement the item in memory until it is null.

### Pseudo-opcodes

In addition to these opcodes, there are five pseudo-opcodes. They do not provide more possibilities, but they optimize by a lot the execution. The available pseudo-codes are the following:
> `R` that is equivalent to the character `>` *x* times where *x* is the number represented by the two following bytes.  
> `L` that is equivalent to the character `<` *x* times where *x* is the number represented by the two following bytes.  
> `A` that is equivalent to the character `+` *x* times where *x* is the number represented by the two following bytes.  
> `S` that is equivalent to the character `-` *x* times where *x* is the number represented by the two following bytes.  
> `0` that resets the item at the memory address that is the last item on the stack to 0. It is equivalent to `[-]`.

For example, `A000c` (encoded `41000c`) is equivalent to `++++++++++++` (encoded `2b2b2b2b2b2b2b2b2b2b2b2b`). These pseudo-opcodes are used during the pre-processing, before the compilation, to optimize duplications of opcodes and `[-]` loops (replaced by `0##`). For example, `>>>>>>>` (encoded `3e3e3e3e3e3e3e`) is replaced by `R0007####` (encoded `52000723232323`). It is not clear if it is intentional, but we can use these pseudo-opcodes in the input program.

### Invalid opcodes

If an invalid opcode is given in the input program (not in the opcodes and pseudo-opcodes listed above), it will be added as it in the output EVM bytecode, but it will be preceded by the two opcodes `dead` and succeded by the two opcodes `beef`, that are only invalid EVM opcodes.

## Presentation of some unexpected behaviors of the compiler

The compiler has a few unexpected behaviors (and the author apologizes for that in the comments on the contract). We list here all those we have found, but not all of them will be used in our solution.

### 1. Pseudo-opcodes don't escape the following characters

The four pseudo-opcodes `R`, `L`, `A` and `S` read during the compilation the two following bytes to determine the number of repetitions. But these two bytes are considered as normal input opcodes during the pre-processing, especially during the loop detection. So, if for example there is in the input programe the opcodes `A005b` (encoded `41005b`) to add 91 to the last element on the stack, it will be interpreted as `A00[` (because `[` is encoded by `5b`) during the pre-processing. So, during the loop detection, it will consider that there is here the beginning of a new loop. It can make the transaction revert (it can happen if all the square brackets are not matched), or worse, add unexpected loops in the code.

### 2. The optimization pass doesn't replace the correct number of opcodes

To optimize duplicate input opcodes, the optimization pass replaces them with pseudo-opcodes. To avoid re-indexing the opcodes in the list, the remaining opcodes are replaced by `#` (the input opcode that does nothing). For example, `++++++++++++` is replaced by `A000c#########`. But, the number of opcodes to replace is wrongly computed. Indeed, in a series of several identical opcodes, the opcodes `#` are ignored (because `+++###+++-` is equivalent `++++++`), but the number of ignored opcodes is not computed. So, `+++###+++-` will be replaced by `+++A0006###-` instead of `A0006######-`. Note that here the final `-` is necessary because the compiler doesn't replace a repetition of opcodes if it is at the end of the input program (another unexpected behaviour but without any repercussion). Eventually, here 9 will be added instead of 6. In the general case, it will execute more time that expected the action.

### 3. Invalid opcodes can badly influence the output code

In theory, the invalid input opcodes are not accessible by any means because they are surrounded by invalid EVM opcodes. Indeed, if the program counter should naturally arrive to the invalid input opcode, the transaction will revert because it is preceeded by invalid EVM opcodes. We also can't jump on them because it needs a `JUMPDEST` opcode, that is `5b`, the encoding of `[`, a valid input opcode. But, if we put a `PUSHN` opcode with $N > 2$, it will escape opcodes that are further. Indeed, the N bytes following a `PUSHN` are escaped, in the sense that they can't be executed as actual opcodes. So, any `PUSHN` with $N > 2$ in the input program can lead to unexpected behaviours.

### 4. There is no check that all the opened square brackets are closed

An input program with opened square brackets that are not closed is accepted and will go through the pre-processing without any problem. It can revert during the compilation, but not necessarly. Indeed, if an unmatched square bracket is opened at the index `i` in the input program, `loop[i]` won't be affected, so it will have a null value. Thus, a `BasicBlock` will be created with the field `dst2` set to 1 (that is`loop[i] + 1`). If there is no block that begins at the index 1, the compilation will revert at the line 293:

```solidity
uint dst = basicBlockAddrs[labels[i].dstBlock];
if (dst == 0) revert("invalid code");
```

But if there is a block that begins at the index 1, `basicBlockAddrs[1]` won't be null, and the loop beginning at the unmatched `[` will jump to the same line as after the first block if the condition to enter the loop is not met.

### 5. Not all the storage variables are cleaned after an execution

Almost all the storage variables are cleaned when they are no more used, in order to reset them for the next execution. But two storage variables are not reset: the mappings `loops` and `basicBlockAddrs` (because they are mapping, so it is impossible to reset them, the keyword `delete` doesn't work on mappings). So, these two mappings will keep their values of the end of the execution in a later execution. Since these two mappings are involved in [the previous unexpected behaviour](#4-there-is-no-check-that-all-the-opened-square-brackets-are-closed), we can combine them to create jumps to the destination of our choice.

## Building the solution

Since the contract makes a `delegatecall` to the deployed contract, the objective is solely to make the function `invoke` deploy a contract that sends its funds to someone. But here's a problem: no input opcode lets you make a `call`, the common way to send ethers to someone. Even worse, we don't interact freely with the stack, that maintains almost all the time a depth of 2. The opcode `CALL` needs 7 elements on the stack, so it seems impossible to make a `call`. But there is another opcode that transfers ethers: the opcode `SELFDESTRUCT` (`ff`). The advantages of this opcode are it requires only one element on the stack, and it transfers all the funds the contract has, there is no need to specify the amount. Therefore, our objective will be to make the compiler put the byte `ff` in the EVM bytecode, and to make this opcode accessible in an execution.

But `ff` is never written in the EVM bytecode by valid input opcodes. There are only two ways to make the compiler write an opcode of our choice in the output EVM bytecode:
- Put it as it, it will be treated as an invalid opcode so surrounded by invalid opcodes, but it will be inaccessible.
- It can be put in the 2 bytes following a pseudo-opcode `R`, `L`, `A` or `S`. Indeed, these pseudo-opcodes generate a `PUSH4` opcode followed with the two bytes we put after the pseudo-opcode.

Since the first option seems to make the `ff` opcode inaccessible, we will explore the second option. For example, if in the input program there is `Aff00` (encoded `41ff00`), the compiler will add somewhere in the output EVM bytecode `63ff00` (`PUSH4 0xff00`). But here, the opcode `ff` is inside the scope of a `PUSH4`, so there is no way that it can be executed. We need to make this opcode executable. To do so, we can escape the `63` opcode (`PUSH4`) with another `PUSH` opcode placed before. We saw [before](#3-invalid-opcodes-can-badly-influence-the-output-code) how to do that: we can put a `PUSHN` opcode, with $N$ enough large, in the input program such that, even if it is surrouded by invalid opcodes, it can escape the `PUSH4` opcode before `ff00`. To determine the value of $N$, we need to know the exact bytecode created by the input program `Aff00`. We see in the code:

```solidity
} else if (op == "A") {
    code.push(OP_DUP1);
    code.push(OP_MLOAD);
    code.push(OP_PUSH2); code.push(uint8(program[j+1])); code.push(uint8(program[j+2]));
    code.push(OP_ADD);
    code.push(OP_DUP2);
    code.push(OP_MSTORE);
    j += 2;
```

So the output EVM bytecode created by the input `Aff00` is `805161ff00018152` (`JUMPDEST DUP1 MLOAD PUSH2 0xff00 ADD DUP2 MSTORE`). So, we need a `PUSHN` that escapes the 3 opcodes before `ff` (`805161`), and the 2 invalid EVM opcodes that follow the invalid input opcode (`beef`). Thus, we need a `PUSH5` (`64`).

Then, if in the input program contains `64Aff00` (encoded `6441ff00`), it will create in the output EVM bytecode `dead64beef805161ff00018152` (`INVALID INVALID PUSH5 0xbeef805161 SELFDESTRUCT RETURN ADD DUP2 MSTORE`).

Knowing that we can make the compiler add jumps with the destination of our choice, as [explained above](#5-not-all-the-storage-variables-are-cleaned-after-an-execution), we now have to make a jump to the opcode `SELFDESTRUCT`. But we can only jump on a `JUMPDEST`. That is not a problem, because after the pseudo-opcode `A`, we can put the two bytes of our choice (we previously chose `ff00`, but the `00` is arbitrary). So, we can replace `ff00` by `5bff` (`JUMPDEST SELFDESTRUCT`). Our input program will contain `64A5bff` (encoded `64415bff`). It will produce the EVM bytecode `dead64beef8051615bff018152` (`INVALID INVALID PUSH5 0xbeef805161 JUMPDEST SELFDESTRUCT ADD DUP2 MSTORE`). We now have to create a `JUMP` that will jump on this opcode `JUMPDEST`.

If we want to make a jump to the destination of our choice, we need to make two transactions: one that will modify the mappings `loops` and `basicBlockAddrs`, and one that will use it to deploy the contract that will `selfdestruct`. The idea is that the first input program will have only one loop, and the second input program will contain an unmatched square bracket such that it will jump to a line defined by the first transaction. The second input program will also contain `64A5bff`, as explained above, and the objective is to make it jump on the `JUMPDEST` we inserted.

We will take for the first input program the following:
```
##########################[##]
```

That gives when it is encoded:
```
23232323232323232323232323232323232323232323232323235b23235d
```

The deployed bytecode is:
```
0x60006180005b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b8051630000002f576300000038565b5b5b6300000020565b00
```

We let some space at the beginning to let us a margin for some adjustements in the second input program. This program does almost nothing, but compiles and runs finely. But after the first execution, some mappings are affected. In particular, we have:

```solidity
loops[26] = 29 // `[` is matched to `]`
basicBlockAddrs[30] = 56 // dst2 of the loop is the destination after the loop, here almost the end of the bytecode
```

Then, we need to put an unmatched square bracket in the second input program. If `i` is the index of the square bracket in the input program, we need `basicBlockAddrs[loop[i] + 1]` to be not null. Because the square bracket is unmatched, `loop[29]` is not redefined, and if there is no block in the second execution that begins at the index 30, `basicBlockAddrs[30]` is not redefined aswell. Then we can take `i = 29`. Like that, if the loop condition is not met, the jump will point to the index 56. Because we also need to include the code `64A5bff`, our second input program will look like that:

```
#####[64A5bff]]##############[######
```

Note that the last `[` opcode is at the same index as the same opcode in the first input program. We put our code `64A5bff` in a loop in order to escape this sequence: if we do not affect the memory, we will never enter in any loop. We took care of closing all the opened square bracket except the last one. Note that we had to add another `]` because as explained [here](#1-pseudo-opcodes-dont-escape-the-following-characters), the byte `5b` will be considered as the beginning of a loop even if it is after the pseudo-opcode `A`. If we try to compile this input program, we obtain the following EVM bytecode:

```
0x60006180005b5b5b5b5b5b5b8051630000001a57630000004a565bdead64beef8051615bff0181525b80516300000037576300000043565bdeadffbeef6300000028565b630000000b565b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b80516300000068576300000038565b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b00
```

We see that the opcode on which we would like to jump (a `5b` (`JUMPDEST`) before a `ff` (`SELFDESTRUCT`)) is at the index 35. But we want it to be at the index 56, because it is where our modified `JUMP` goes. We can replace some `#` opcodes at the beginning by others input opcodes in order to add more bytecode at the beginning, and to shift the index of the `JUMPDEST` to the right. The only restriction on the input opcodes is that we can't use those that affect the memory (because we need it to be untouched to avoid entering the loops). With some tries or computations, we find that the following input program puts the `JUMPDEST` at the index 56 and works fine:

```
,-<##[64A5bff]]##############[######
```

The encoded version of the second input program is:

```
2c2d3c23235b64415bff5d5d23232323232323232323232323235b232323232323
```

The second input program will depploy the following bytecode:
```
0x60006180005b5b5b5b5b5b5b8051630000001a57630000004a565bdead64beef8051615bff0181525b80516300000037576300000043565bdeadffbeef6300000028565b630000000b565b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b80516300000068576300000038565b5b5b5b5b5b5b5b00
```

By executing the two transactions in a row, the contract will `selfdestruct` and send all of his funds, the 50 ethers, to an address. We can deploy [`Solution.sol`](Solution.sol) that solves the challenge at the deployment.
